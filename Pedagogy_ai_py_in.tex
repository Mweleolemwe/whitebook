pedagogy_pipeline.py is a replication-ready Python 3 tool for computing the core metrics of the MWƐN / Onu-ledger pedagogy across acoustics, physiology, and room impulse responses. The pipeline implements (i) log-frequency spectral settling via the variance of log-power on a uniform  grid, ; (ii) ledger-consistent HRV indices including RMSSD and RMSLR (root mean square of successive log-ratios), plus LF power and peak near 0.1 Hz; (iii) optional respiration instantaneous-rate variance (Hilbert) and RR–respiration coherence; and (iv) optional room-acoustics analysis (IR PSD variance and RT60 via Schroeder). Inputs are simple WAV/CSV files; outputs include JSON/Lua metrics and quick-look PNGs for papers built with LaTeX. The design emphasizes transparent, reproducible settings (Welch PSD, stabilized log, fixed bands) so that independent users can replicate the “one metric spine” result  across facets.
